  },
  monthlyIncome: {
    term: "Monthly Income",
    explanation: "Expected monthly cash flow from all your active investments. This is the total rent payments coming to you each month.",
    example: "Property A pays $2k/month, Property B pays $1.5k/month â†’ Your monthly income is $3.5k.",

  },
  netIRR: {
    term: "Net IRR (Internal Rate of Return)",
    explanation: "Your portfolio's annualized return rate after accounting for all cash flows (investments and payments). Higher is better!",
    example: "15% Net IRR means for every $100 invested, you earn $15 profit per year.",
    blockchainIntegration: "IRR is calculated using on-chain payment history from the smart contract. All transactions are verifiable and transparent."
  },
  activeDeals: {
    term: "Active Deals",
    explanation: "Number of rental properties you're currently funding. These are investments where rent payments are actively streaming to you.",
    example: "If you funded 5 properties and 2 completed their terms, you have 3 active deals remaining.",
    blockchainIntegration: "Each deal is represented by a loan NFT (TRR token) you hold. View all your NFTs on Kodadot marketplace."
  },
  riskTier: {
    term: "Risk Tier",
    explanation: "A letter grade (A, B, C) indicating the quality and risk of the rental property. Tier A = lowest risk, best tenants.",
    example: "Tier A: Excellent tenant, always pays on time, stable income â†’ Lower IRR but safer. Tier C: Higher risk â†’ Higher IRR to compensate.",
    blockchainIntegration: "Risk tier is algorithmically calculated from tenant credit score stored in the rental NFT metadata on Base."

  },
  irr: {
    term: "IRR (APR)",
    explanation: "Your annual percentage return on this investment. This is the interest rate you earn for providing the advance.",
    example: "12% IRR means if you invest $100k, you'll receive ~$112k back over the term (monthly installments).",
    blockchainIntegration: "IRR parameters are set in the RiskTier contract and enforced on-chain. Can't be changed after deployment."
  },
  haircut: {
    term: "Haircut",
    explanation: "Safety buffer (discount) applied to the property's total rent value before calculating advance. Protects you from defaults.",
    example: "Property has $100k total rent, 15% haircut â†’ Only $85k is used for advance calculation. You're protected if tenant pays late.",
    blockchainIntegration: "Haircut percentage is stored in the smart contract's risk tier parameters and automatically applied to all calculations."
  },
  oc: {
    term: "Over-Collateralization (OC)",
    explanation: "Extra security requirement. The property must be worth MORE than what you lend. Protects investors from loss.",
    example: "10% OC means: If advance is $90k, property's rental contract must be worth at least $99k ($90k Ã· 0.91).",
    blockchainIntegration: "Smart contract verifies OC ratio before allowing loan requests. Your capital is always over-collateralized on-chain."
  },

  },
  termMonths: {
    term: "Term (Months)",
    explanation: "Duration of the investment. How long you'll receive monthly rent payments before the loan is fully repaid.",
    example: "12-month term means you'll receive monthly payments for 1 year, then your capital + profit is fully returned.",
    blockchainIntegration: "Term is stored in the loan struct on-chain. Smart contract enforces payment schedules based on this duration."
  },
  marketplace: {
    term: "Marketplace",
    explanation: "Where you browse available properties to fund. Property owners list their advance requests here for investors like you.",
    example: "See 20 properties available: Filter by Tier A, 12-month term, 15%+ IRR â†’ Choose best match for your strategy.",
    blockchainIntegration: "Marketplace pulls live data from Base blockchain. All listed properties have verified NFTs and on-chain data."
  },
  nextPayment: {
    term: "Next Payment",
    explanation: "Date when you'll receive the next rent installment. Payments are typically monthly and automated via smart contracts.",
    example: "If next payment is Dec 1st, expect rent to hit your wallet automatically on that date.",
    blockchainIntegration: "Payment dates are calculated from the loan funding timestamp. Rent streams automatically via smart contract."
  },
  status: {
    term: "Loan Status",
    explanation: "Current state of your investment: Active (earning rent), Completed (fully paid), or Default (payment issues).",
