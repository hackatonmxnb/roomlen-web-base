// Specific terms for Owner Dashboard
export const OWNER_TERMS = {
  tokenize: {
    term: "Tokenize",
    explanation: "Converting your rental contract into a digital asset (NFT) that lives on the blockchain. This makes it verifiable, tradeable, and usable as collateral.",
    example: "Your rental contract becomes NFT #1234, which you can use to request advances or sell on a marketplace.",
    blockchainIntegration: "We create an ERC-721 NFT on Base's Base Sepolia that stores your rental agreement details (rent amount, term, tenant score) permanently on-chain."
  },
  advance: {
    term: "Advance",
    explanation: "Immediate cash you receive today in exchange for your future rent payments. Instead of waiting months for rent, get 80-90% upfront.",
    example: "If your tenant pays $10,000/month for 12 months, you can receive ~$92,000 today instead of waiting 12 months.",
    blockchainIntegration: "When an investor funds your request, a smart contract on Base transfers wMXNB tokens to your wallet instantly and automatically."
  },
  riskTier: {
    term: "Risk Tier",
    explanation: "A grade (A, B, or C) that determines your advance terms based on tenant quality, payment history, and property factors. Better tier = more money, lower rates.",
    example: "Tier A (excellent): Get 90% advance at 15% APR. Tier C (fair): Get 78% advance at 28% APR.",
    blockchainIntegration: "The smart contract reads your tenant score from the NFT and automatically calculates your tier using on-chain risk parameters stored in the LendingProtocol contract."
  },
  haircut: {
    term: "Haircut",
    explanation: "A safety buffer (discount) applied to protect investors from risk. The percentage deducted from your total rent value before calculating the advance.",
    example: "With a 10% haircut on $120,000 total rent: $120,000 - 10% = $108,000 is used for your advance calculation.",
    blockchainIntegration: "Haircut percentage is stored in the risk tier parameters on Base and automatically applied by the smart contract when calculating loan amounts."
  },
  oc: {
    term: "Over-Collateral (OC)",
    explanation: "Extra collateral required to secure the advance. Your property must be worth more than the advance amount to protect investors.",
    example: "10% OC means if you want $90,000, your rental contract must be worth at least $99,000.",
    blockchainIntegration: "The smart contract verifies your NFT's rental value meets the OC requirement before allowing loan requests. This is enforced on-chain."
  },
  marketplace: {
    term: "Marketplace",
    explanation: "Where investors browse and fund advance requests. Once you publish, investors can see your property details and choose to fund you.",
    example: "Your tokenized property appears in the marketplace with details: $92,000 advance, 15% APR, Tier A, 12-month term.",
    blockchainIntegration: "Publishing creates a loan request transaction on Base that emits a LoanRequested event. Investors monitor these events to find opportunities."
  },
  nft: {
    term: "NFT (Digital Certificate)",
    explanation: "A unique digital token that proves you own the rental agreement. It's like a digital deed that can't be copied or faked.",
    example: "Your NFT #5678 contains: Property address, $10k/month rent, 12-month term, tenant score 85.",
    blockchainIntegration: "Your NFT is minted on Base using the ERC-721 standard. View it on BaseScan explorer and trade it on OpenSea NFT marketplace."
  },
  baseSepolia: {
    term: "Base Sepolia",
    explanation: "A test version of Base blockchain where we safely demonstrate RoomLen without using real money. Perfect for this hackathon!",
    example: "ETH tokens are free test tokens with no real value, allowing you to try everything risk-free.",
    blockchainIntegration: "All RoomLen contracts are deployed on Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532). Transactions are instant, free, and fully transparent on BaseScan explorer."
  },
  explorer: {
    term: "Block Explorer",
    explanation: "A website where you can see all blockchain transactions in real-time. It's like a public ledger anyone can verify.",
    example: "Click 'View on Explorer' to see your tokenization transaction, who created it, when, and all the details.",
    blockchainIntegration: "We use BaseScan for Base Sepolia. Every tokenization, loan request, and payment is permanently recorded and verifiable."
  }
